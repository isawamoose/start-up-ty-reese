### Elevator Pitch

I'm working on building the basics of a job comparison app. While job searching, it can be a stressful experience to decide between two or more job offers. Comparing salary alone doesnt cut it when there are various other benefits like stock options, insurance, and retirement programs. This app will put it all in one place, clearly displaying which job performs better in separate categories to give the user the most informed choice for their career.

### Key Features
- Job information entry boxes with titles (and explanations?)
- 
- Saved user login attached to previously entered job information


## How I'll use each technology
**HTML**
- The scructure of the web page in the browser

**CSS**
- Formatting of the web page

**JavaScript**
- Validates the form was filled out correctly and shows error messages
- Calculates the overall score of the entered info
- Updates displayed stock price
- Sends the data to the server via web sockets

**Calling Web Services**
- A save button that sends the entered job information to the server
- retrieving the stock price of the job offer's stock options

**Providing Web Services**
- Recieves the job information from the browser and then saves it

**Authentication**
- Saved login information for a user so they can access previously entered job information

**Storing Data Persistently**
- Previous job offers entered into the system

**Database Data**
- Displays previously entered job offer information overviews

**Web Sockets**
- I'm going to use web sockets to send a retrieve the entered job information
- Real time example: updating the displayed stock price in real time
